		<description>
			<p>Some fighters are ruthlessly pragmatic when it comes to battle. They know that strength of arms is not enough to bring down certain opponents, and that some enemies could get the upper hand through a stroke of luck. And so, they do not rely on martial prowess alone to attain victory. These fighters call themselves Scorpion Knights, and they emulate their namesakes by coating their weapons with debilitating poisons. A Scorpion Knight is a patient killer, whittling her opponent away with envenomed strikes until the foe can barely stand.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to create simple but effective poisons. You can spend an hour and 20 GP worth of materials to create a poison called Scorpion Knight’s Venom using a poisoner’s kit. You can then spend a bonus action to apply this poison to a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. While a weapon is coated with this poison, it deals an extra 1d4 poison damage to any target it hits.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you create a batch of Scorpion Knight’s Venom, you create enough for four separate applications. One application is enough to coat a single melee weapon, or twenty pieces of ammunition. The poison dries out 1 minute after it is applied.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your Scorpion Knight’s Venom becomes more potent when you reach certain levels in this class. The damage it inflicts increases to 1d6 at 7th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 18th level.</p>

		<description>
			<p>By 10th level, you have learned how to enhance your Scorpion Knight’s Venom in various ways. When you create a batch of Scorpion Knight’s Venom, you can choose to apply one of the following additional effects to that batch.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Necrotizing Venom.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a weapon coated in your Scorpion Knight’s Venom, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of its turn.</li>
				<li><b><i>Opthalmic Venom.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a weapon coated in your Scorpion Knight’s Venom, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is also blinded.</li>
				<li><b><i>Paralytic Venom.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a weapon coated in your Scorpion Knight’s Venom, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is also paralyzed.</li>
				<li><b><i>Psychotropic Venom.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a weapon coated in your Scorpion Knight’s Venom, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is also frightened and must roll a D6 at the start of its turn. On a roll of 1, the creature attacks the nearest creature it can see. On a roll of 2-5, the creature takes no action this turn as it cowers from imaginary threats. On a roll of 6, the creature can act normally this turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">The saving throw DC for these effects equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

Any poison you create ignores resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. Creatures that are normally immune to poison damage take half damage from your poisons instead.</p>
