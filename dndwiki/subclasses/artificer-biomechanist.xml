			<p>Biomechanists are artificers who follow a rather odd course of study- using technology to improve and enhance living organisms. They understand the workings of the humanoid body and use their knowledge to fuse their creations with flesh. They are particularly deadly adversaries, as they can make even the weakest of creatures powerful foes, attack a creature from the inside out, and even create new life. Biomechanics is a field of technology shunned by most, as many see it as evil or morally wrong. Still, a few brave souls follow this path to push the limits of technology and the humanoid body.</p>

You may also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as a bonus action to create a bioweapon, creating a number of bioweapons equal to the level of the spell slot.

			<p class="indent">As an action, you can throw one of the bioweapons at a point within 60 feet of you. Every creature within a 10-foot radius of the point must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, they take 2d8 poison damage, and they take an additional 1d8 poison damage at the start of each of their turns for 1 minute. They may repeat the saving throw at the start of each their turns, ending the effect on a success. If they magically regain hitpoints or are affected by lesser restoration or similar magic, then the effect ends early.</p>

As an action, you can attempt to boost or cripple the genetic code of a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your intelligence modifier.
