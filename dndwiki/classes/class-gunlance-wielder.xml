        <description>
            <p>A combat military specialist trained to deal to use a unique weapon against extremely dangerous threats and to be able to operate with minimal support for long periods of time while acting as a solo shock trooper. The gunlance is a rare weapon and difficult to use properly. Those who train to use it are also trained to be able to function without significant backup for long periods of time. Because of this, they can function both alone and with a proper team. They also upgrade and maintain their weapon themselves, customizing it to suit their individual needs.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A Gunlance Wielder</h4>
            <p>When creating a Gunlance Wielder, work with your DM to figure out how they fit into the setting of the campaign and craft your backstory accordingly. Why was your character selected to be trained in this weapon? Did they pursue such training themselves? Did they do something to earn the honor?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can quickly make a Gunlance Wielder by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in either Strength or Constitution, with whichever you didn't choose as your highest ability score being your second highest. Then choose the soldier background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <p>The signature weapon of the Gunlance Wielder. Gunlances are heavy polearm cannons that, in their default state, take two hands to wield. While they don't start overtly powerful, a good Gunlance Wielder will eventually customize their weapon to be far more powerful than it was when they first began to wield it. This will increase both its raw power and usability as they become more skilled at maintaining and using their weapon, and customize it to suit their needs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gunlances start out dealing 1d6 piercing damage while using Str as it's accuracy and damage ability at level one, but as the Gunlance Wielder improves, so too will their weapon. The number of damage dice they roll for their weapon increases at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20. At a certain point, the Gunlance Wielder will begin to specialize their gunlance to their fighting style and the damage die will change. See Gunlance Specializations.</p>

            <p>Gunlances, as the name indicates, are ranged weapons as well as melee weapons. Each gunlance has an internal cylinder magazine that holds its shells. These shells may be fire as a ranged attack until the magazine is depleted, at which point the Gunlance Wielder has to pause to reload. These shells are initially no stronger than the lance itself, merely allowing the Gunlance Wielder to attack at range as well as up close. However, like the lance itself, the power of each shell shot will increase as the Gunlance Wielder grows more familiar with their weapon and improves it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gunlance shelling starts with a range of 30/120 feet and deals 1d6 piercing damage per shot, initially holding 3 shells per reload, and uses Dex as its accuracy and damage ability. Both the range and the type of damage type rolled will increase as the Gunlance Wielder customizes their gunlance, see Gunlance Specializations. The number of damage die rolled as well as how many shells the gunlance holds per reload increases at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.</p>

The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>

			<p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>

Starting from Level 13, the Gunlance Wielder can use this feature to fire a special shell that does 3d6 Piercing damage. If the enemy is airborne when hit with the Anti-Air Flare, they must make a constitution saving throw with a DC equal to that of the Gunlance Wielder's Dex modifier + their proficiency bonus + 8. If they fail, they are knocked to the ground and are left prone until their next turn. If they fall more than 10 feet, they take 1d6 fall damage for every 10 feet they fall.</p>

            <p>Sentries primarily serve as protection for their allies, and at times that means taking the hit for them. At Level Ten, the sentry can use their reaction to put themselves between an ally and an enemy, taking the hit for their companion. If the attack against their ally would fail to hit the sentry, the sentry takes no damage. Otherwise, they take full damage.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A complicated technique that Sentries have developed in order to avoid having to lower their guard while reloading, Guard Reload relies on using the impact of an attack on the Sentry's shield in order to reload their gunlance. At Level 15, the Sentry can use their reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack against them, reloading their gunlance if the attack does not hit. This feature requires a shield in order to be used.</p>

            <p>The ultimate defensive technique developed by the Sentries, Fortress Wall draws enemy fire towards themselves at the cost of their own movement. At Level 18, the Sentry can use this feature to draw all attacks by enemies within 15 feet of them towards the Sentry until the start of their next turn. The Sentry cannot move on the turn they use this feature, nor can they use their reaction until their next turn, but all attacks against them have disadvantage while this feature is active. This feature can be used an equal number of times to the Sentry's Con modifier per long rest.</p>
