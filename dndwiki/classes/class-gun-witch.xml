        <description>
            <p>One shot. Two shots. A shimmering bolt of lightning as smoke clears from the scene. A fearless warrior-witch accustomed to the martial art of gunfighting, moving across the battlefield like a specter or some supernatural beast as ring of gunfire disorients the senses as the smell of blackpowder lingers in the air. Cloaked and strapped to the teeth with ranged weaponry, using the arcane arts in between each shot of their weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">As hordes of enemies close in, a blaze of magical shots fire off, obliterating their forces, with bolts of fire and rays of frost bursting from the tips of their deadly tools. They become less like a gunslinger and more like a force of nature.</p>
            <p class="indent">This class is very much a mixture of Weird West, Witch, and Gunslinger tropes. This is the ideal for a ranged fighter using arcane tricks, especially with its half caster spellcasting.</p>
            <h4>Weird, Wild Gunslingers</h4>
            <p><em>"The exalted order of Gun Witches was founded in R.E. 3440 and is the fourth order of witches after the Blade witches. Needless to say, it is by far the most feared."</em> - Tales of the Multiverse.</p>
            <p>Gun Witches are not proper spellcasters, though they do make use of the arcane arts in some of their techniques. They are best known for being trained in extreme forms of firearm and bow based martial arts. Over the millennia, the original Order descended into legend as the legendary warrior-magicians became myth, but a few lived on creating covens that live on to teach the art of weapon hexing and using special components along with materials to cast spells through these explosive weapons. The sole creators of a mysterious gunpowder crafted with dark alchemy and ammunition inscribed with hex-runes. Most Gun Witches now a days are notorious bounty hunters, using the bounties to fund their covens.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A Gun Witch</h4>
            <p>As you create your Gun Witch, consider the circumstances that enabled you to learn your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, learning under a hedge witch who had access to crude firearms? Or did you become part of a militia-coven that protected a settlement from the supernatural or strange dangers surrounding the town? What caused you to break away from your training? How did you learn your skills? On the road as a lone traveler? Or as someone desperate to survive? Or did you use your training for a newfound occupation? You might be a hedge witch yourself that came across a coven of Gun Witches training in the solitude of an ancient sanctuary. How did you stumble upon the methods of mixing the arcane arts with gun fighting?</p>
            <p class="indent">How do you continue creating your mysterious hexes? Do you run an alchemy gig on the side? How did you choose your Familiar Weapon? How is it special to you? Have you give it a name? Is it a sentient weapon? Or is it just the best weapon in your hands? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, attempting to learn more of the strange teachings that guide your ways, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to travelling with new allies, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Gun Witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the Bounty Hunter or Far Traveler background. Third, choose the Pistol, the Component Pouch with 20 Bullets, and the an explorer's pack. As an aside, the rules for firearms are in the pg.267 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If you're running a campaign with no guns, this class can function with the regular ranged options in the Player's Handbook.</p>

            <p>Choose a weapon to hammer with arcane enchantments, hedge magic, and spell-worked runes. It becomes a Familiar Weapon. At 6th and 10th level, you can choose an additional weapon to be a Familiar Weapon. At 10th level, you can magically summon any of your Familiar Weapons to your side. If you lose or replace your Familiar Weapon, the process to create another takes 2 hours and cost 10 gp for the materials.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gain a d6. Whenever you successfully attack with your Familiar Weapon, reduce the value of this die by 1. When the value of this die reaches 1, you can spend it as a bonus action to make your next attack with your Familiar Weapon deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage. After spending this die, hit or miss, it resets back to 6. When you finish a short or long rest this die resets back to 6. At 10th level and 20th level, this damage increases to 2d6 and 3d6 respectively.</p>

                <h5>Familiar Weapon Die</h5>
                <p>When you gain the Familiar Weapon die, it acts like a countdown and not like a regular die that you roll. If you’re tracking the die physically, grab a d6, place it on the face with six pips, and decrease the face by 1 every time you decrease the die. If you’re playing virtually, treat the Familiar Weapon die like it is a countdown that starts at 6 and ends at 1.</p>

        <description>
			<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of your hexes to cast Spells, much as a sorcerer or wizard does. See the general rules of Spellcasting and the Gun Witch spell list.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Gun Witch table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Gun Witch Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Witch Bolt and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Witch Bolt⁠ using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level Spells of your choice from the Gun Witch spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Gun Witch table shows when you learn more Gun Witch spells⁠ of your choice. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Gun Witch Spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Gun Witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Gun Witch spells. The power of your spells comes from the hexes hammered into your weapons. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Gun Witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <p>It's all about the eyes. Eyes are the window to the soul, as well the road for a bullet to someone's heart. Manipulating their natural bodies to improve their prowess with their shooting iron. Gun Witches who practice the traditions of the Coven of Eyes often live in the wilds mimicking beasts and nature to replicate them in their reflexes, as well as gathering reagents and using magics to augment themselves further. These Witches often have strange eyes as indicators of their association with the Coven.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you engrave a hex sigil or rune on a set of small stones, small bones, or dice. Gain two d6; as an action, you can roll these dice to produce a magical effect.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drop your hexed runes at your current space, they melt into the ground. As an action, you can teleport back to this space as long as you remain within 60 feet of it. You can do this once, then you would need to roll this effect again. After an hour, the runes magic fades and you are unable to use this action.</li>
                <li>Throw your hexed runes at a space within 30 feet, they explode and flash with a bright light. Each creature within 10 feet of the space of where the runes landed must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they are blinded until the end of their next turn.</li>
                <li>Your runes harmlessly burn into your hands producing a red smoke around you, concealing you. This smokes functions the same as half cover. This smoke lasts until the end of your next turn.</li>

            <p class="indent">After roll these hexed trinkets three times, you need to finish a short rest before you can use this feature again. At 7th, 11th, and 15th level increase the number of times you can use this feature by 1 (Ex. at 7th level, you can roll the hexed trinkets four times and etc). If you lose these trinkets, the process to replace them takes an hour.</p>

            <p>At 7th level, you can use your Smith's Tools to hammer hexes into your ammunition. When you do so, the process takes up to two hours per 10 ammunition (arrows, bullets, etc.) to convert it into the desired hexed ammunition. You can use this process on silvered ammunition and it retains its silvered property in addition to becoming hexed. You must declare you are using this ammunition when you load or reload your weapon. You can craft two unique ammunition types.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Banshee Hex Ammunition.</strong> On a successful hit, the enemy must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage. This damage counts as magical for the purpose of resistances. On a critical hit, an enemy who fails the saving throw becomes frightened.</li>
                <li><strong>Behir Hex Ammunition.</strong> On a successful hit, replace your ammunition damage type with lightning damage. This damage counts as magical for the purpose of resistances. On a critical hit, the enemy must succeed a Constitution saving throw or become stunned.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">If someone uses a non-hexed weapon or a weapon that isn't your familiar weapon to fire this ammunition, after the attack roll, roll a percentile die. If the outcome is below 50, the weapon breaks.</p>

            <p>At 11th level, you hammer more potent magic in to your hexed weapons and ammunition. After hitting an enemy with hexed weapon or ammunition their AC is lowered by 1. This doesn't apply more than once. When you fire your last piece of hexed ammunition, flip a coin. On heads, on a successful hit it deals 1d4 force damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the creature you hit. On tails, on a successful hit it deals 1d4 necrotic damage at the end of the creature's next turn.</p>

            <p>At 15th level, your hexed ammunition becomes more potent in your hands. When declaring an attack you speak a set of magic words that your weapon responds to. If your attack is successful, the ammunition creates a small magical explosion that knocks the enemy back 10 feet. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). Then, you need to finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to this, you can use the remaining cantrips on the Weapon Hex list with your hexed weapons. You also learn a third ammunition hex.</p>
