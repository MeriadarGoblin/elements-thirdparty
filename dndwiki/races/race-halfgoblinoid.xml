		<description>
			<p>Goblinoids are a rapacious race of diverse creatures. Their offspring with humans tend to be rather reflective of that.</p>
			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>Half goblinoids strangely share a lot of similar traits despite possibly hailing from different goblinoids. They retain a humanoid shape, and have squashed flat noses usually, with pointed ears and small, mean eyes. There are minute differences between each different group. Half-hobgoblin noses change color to turn colorful when they are angry. Half-goblins are slightly shorter than the others of this race. Half-bugbears tend to be very hirsute.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Throughout the successful years of goblinoids since Maglubiyet restructured their pantheon, they have experienced a golden age in conquest. Fear of the conquering host of goblinoids is now more commonplace than ever. In their conquests, there have inevitably been instances where their blood mixed with that of humans, creating the half-goblinoids. These creatures have an almost worse place in society than even a goblin would, due to their status as a half-breed. Few live to their full potential due to being outcasts by both humans and goblinoids. Some are lucky to make it to the pariah caste of goblins.</p>
			<h4>Personality</h4>
			<p>Due to the expectedly harsh upbringing of half-goblinoids, they tend to be very suspicious of kindness and these unfamiliar interactions. Their appearances are sometimes a source of shame for them, be it they don't look human or goblinoid enough. Abuse hardens them to become schemers much like goblins. There are also some small traits they inherit from their respective goblinoid race as well. Those with hobgoblin blood are more likely to be fearless or hate cowardice. Bugbear heritage might mean that they love to bully weaker creatures, as well as rely on surprise to strike.</p>
			<h5>Half-Goblin Names</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Male Names. </strong>Iogz, Kloderg, Ghirok, Hector.</li>
				<li><strong>Female Names. </strong>Botrith, Avrel, Fulzulk, Dagra.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Half-Goblin Traits</h4>
			<p>Human-goblionoid spawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution or Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Half goblinoids don't live too long, maturing at around 8 and living to only about 60 or 70 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong>  Many have a cynical and chaotic outlook in life, leaning towards evil even.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> While some are as short as dwarves, your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Scheming Wrath</em></strong> Living under everyone's heel has made you incredibly insidious with your methods. When you target a creature which has dealt you damage previously with an attack or spell, you can channel your rage to roll the attack or spell with advantage. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak Common, Goblin, and one other language of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Choose either bugbear, hobgoblin or goblin heritage.</p>
