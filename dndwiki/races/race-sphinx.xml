			<p>In sacred isolation, a sphinx guards the secrets and treasures of the gods. That's what the legends say, anyway. In truth, sphinxes are a race of beings with a lion's body and a humanoid head, also bearing a set of wings. Due to their strongly lawful nature, they make excellent guardians, and are known to be protectors of many desert lands.</p>
			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>The average sphinx has the body of a lion, along with a humanoid head. Some are recorded as also having wings. They are normally adorned with symbols of the desert gods, such as headdresses depicting suns, symbols of ankhs on their robes, and other such markings. Male sphinxes pride themselves in their beards that stick out from their chins. It is said that the larger a sphinx is, the more powerful it is, with the most powerful of all having wings.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Sphinxes have been in the multiverse since the beginning.</p>
			<h4>Society</h4>
			<p>Sphinxes are solitary creatures, most likely never coming across another of their kind.</p>
			<h4>Sphinx Names</h4>
			<p>Sphinxes have generally Egyptian-sounding names.</p>
			<p><b><i>Male Names: </i></b>Aimenamun, Amset, Binra, Rha-sha-ankh, Thema, Tutmose</p>
			<p><b><i>Female Names: </i></b>Aurera, Hatatsu, Ketet, Menhit, Sefkhabu, Surhet</p>
