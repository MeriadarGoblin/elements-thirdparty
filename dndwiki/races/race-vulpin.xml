			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>Vulpin look similar to humans in the same way that an elf or dwarf would. Vulpin have fox-like ears and/or tails, eyes, and they have slightly longer, fang-like canines. Their hair can be brown, black, white, grey, silver, red or sandy blonde. They can also have a mix of colors in their hair. These mixes are brown and black, white and black, grey and white, white and red, or red and black. Fox eye colors are dark brown, red, yellow, blue-grey, white/ice blue, pale yellow, yellow-green, and forest green. Vulpin are lean and lithe in appearance, being naturally strong, agile, and charming. In addition to their natural lack of bulk, their bones are lighter, granting them more graceful and quick movement at the cost of being more fragile.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Vulpin have always got along well with dwarves, gnomes, and elves, but some human societies and religions never accepted them. By these humans they were seen as nothing more than animals and abominations. Despite vulpin having a reputation to be formidable warriors and very capable and honorable leaders, these humans amassed a very large an impressive army to thin vulpin numbers. The few vulpin kingdoms put up a valient resistance, but they fell in time. With the vulpin kingdoms reduced to rubble and the vulpin dwelling in the larger kingdoms out of reach, the cruel-hearted humans turned to the smaller kingdoms in which larger vulpin societies dwelled. These vulpin societies were those of honorable warriors and mages who had pledged themselves to that country's ruler. Whether the ruler was human or not, the cruel-hearted ones did not care. They tore through these countries all the same. Leaving nothing but rubble and the echoes of the damned. Those that survived spread their tale, and the masterminds of this genocide were put to death. Maybe too little too late, but justice was served all the same as the vulpin executioner brought the axe down on their necks. Despite this large loss of blood, the vulpin seemed no worse for wear. A good portion of their society was nomadic after all, and had managed to avoid the cruel ones gaze. Some of these nomads settled down in the rubble of the fallen kingdoms and began to rebuild, brick by brick.</p>
			<h4>Society</h4>
			<p>Vulpin society is about strengthening oneself and others. Vulpin value the strengthening of personal truths and ideals just as much as they value pursuing the desires of one's heart and soul. They have a natural inclination to move about, preferring not to stay still for any longer than they must. This is part of why they are such good warriors, as even if they are forced to go days without sleep they stay as energetic as ever. This is not to say that they don't feel tired, vulpin find it impolite to complain or to hinder others by asking for help. For example, if a vulpin were suffering from a wound, but they thought that they could take care of it themselves, then they would carry on as if nothing happened until it's companions had fallen asleep. At that point and only then would the vulpin take the time to properly care for the wound. If asking for help hinders the group in any way, they tend to keep their troubles to themselves.</p>
			<p class="indent">A very important part of vulpin society is honor. A vulpin does not go against their word if they ever had the intention of keeping it. When in combat, if their opponent finds themselves on the ground a vulpin will most likely extend a hand to help them up or wait to strike until their opponent has risen and regained their senses. Vulpin strike not to kill, but to incapacitate. They only kill opponents who have killed innocents, betrayed their word or someone else's trust, or those who have gotten in their way. When vulpin set their minds to something their is almost nothing that can stop them, save for a loved one.</p>
