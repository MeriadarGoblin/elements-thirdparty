			<p>The oni-touched are humans meddled with by demons. Gifts and curses have been imparted upon the person. These irregularities go to the next generation too, creating a legacy.</p>
			<h4>Dishonorable Heritage</h4>
			<p>Many oni-touched are humans with a streak of demon blood. Their ancestors dabbled in the dark arts or made a deal with an oni. They committed a heinous act to achieve a blasphemous power. This event changed the very being of the person involved. They may retain the appearance of a normal human, but deep inside is a force very inhuman.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rumors surrounding the city of Numai tell of such events. Established clans, corrupted and dishonored, have such a mark, but this does not hold them back. Their powers cannot be denied, and the nobles of Numai are often seduced. Other oni-touched have kept their heritage a secret.</p>
			<h4>Dark Connections</h4>
			<p>An oni-touched may still have a connection to the original oni that bargained or tampered with their ancestors. The current oni-touched, though removed from said events, may still be beholden to the oni's pact. It is rare to find an oni-touched who does not have some connection to the demons. This can shape their lives in unexpected ways, requiring them to perform distasteful acts or protecting them from other demons.</p>
			<p class="indent">An oni-touched may also reject their ancestor's nagging master. They may seek to break such a pact, gain their freedom, or simply get rid of a known evil. An oni-touched isn't evil by nature, but rather by association after all. They may actually be good and want to destroy that associate. It may take a lifetime, but oni-touched seeking redemption are more common than their masters would like to admit.</p>
			<h4>Oni-Touched Names</h4>
			<p>The naming conventions of oni-touched match those of humans. Those that are born to established families have clan names, but those cast out do not. Those that bind themselves to a lord may take on the clan name of their lord.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Intellect by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Oni-touched mature at the same rate as humans.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Oni-touched are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.</p>
