			<p>"KAMI MANIFEST IN THE FORM OF WHATEVER THEY EMBODY in the physical plane. Some tower in the shape of moss or bark, while others take forms beyond mortal imagining."</p>
			<p>- Anonymous, <em>Moss Kami</em></p>
			<p>The kami-touched are humans blessed (or perhaps cursed) by the spirits. At some point in the conception, pregnancy, or birth of a child, a kami imparted a little bit of itself. The child grows up, forever changed.</p>

			<p class="indent">The kami-touched are humans blessed (or perhaps cursed) by the spirits. At some point in the conception, pregnancy, or birth of a child, a kami imparted a little bit of itself. The child grows up, forever changed.</p>
			<h4>Fundamental Feelings</h4>
			<p>Kami-touched feel a connection with one of the fundamental elements of the world. These fundamental elements are fire, water, earth, air, and the void. This connection will shape how they think and feel. They will often seek out environments or create havens related to the element.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kajin, or those with an affinity for fire, express energy and passion. Their good qualities may include focus, enthusiasm, adventurousness, and charisma. Their bad qualities may include thoughtlessness, frivolity, and impatience. Many kajin are artists, musicians, and craftsman. Some become travelers and adventurers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suijin, or those with an affinity for water, express flexibility and emotion. Their good qualities may include empathy, compassion, generosity, and forgiveness. Their bad qualities may include sensitivity, fearfulness, and naïveté. Many suijin enjoy fishing, sailing, medicine, and jobs related to the community.</p>
			<p class="indent">Chijin, or those with an affinity for earth, express strength and stability. Their good qualities may include confidence, loyalty, honesty, and practicality. Their bad qualities may include stubborness, insensitivity, and inflexibility. Many chijin are reliable workers and like farming, hunting, mining, and other jobs related to the land. Some use their strength in military service or as mercenaries.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fujin, or those with an affinity for air, express intellect and logic. Their good qualities may include ambition, stoicism, cleverness, and being adept. Their bad qualities may include arrogance, aloofness, and selfishness. Many Fujin take an interest in learning, teaching, science, magic, and the law.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kujin, or those with an affinity for void, are the rare among the rare. Less is known about them, but it can be theorized based on the related element how they may tend to express themselves. Kujin could express creativity and abstraction. Their good qualities could include open-mindedness, spontaneity, inventiveness, and the ability to reflect. Their bad qualities could include impracticality, laziness, and indecisiveness. Kujin could be attracted to jobs that deal with ideas and concepts in philosophy, morality, and psychology.</p>

Their bad qualities could include impracticality, laziness, and indecisiveness. Kujin could be attracted to jobs that deal with ideas and concepts in philosophy, morality, and psychology.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kajin typically have physical changes in their eyes and facial expressions. Their eyes sometimes glow with light when they are excited. Their smile is always the warmest around. Their face radiates with a happiness that can change the mood of a room. Skin colors can range from orange and red shades to ashy and black ones. Some even have cracked char-like splotches on their bodies. Hair colors include yellow, orange, and red shades.</p>
			<p class="indent">Suijin usually have physical changes in their extremities. Webbed hands &amp; feet are not uncommon. Scales or shell-like chitin on the forearms and shins may grow. Their skin may be moist to the touch or slightly slimy like an eel. Blue and green skin tones and hair colors are common.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fujin commonly have physical manifestations related to their head and hair. Their hair constantly drifts about, making it appear as though it is without weight. Their temple and crown may grow small crystals that break and float into their hair. Small sparkles on their skin are not uncommon. Skin and hair colors include light blues, grays, and whites.</p>
			<p class="indent">Chijin routinely have physical manifestations related to their body and muscles. They are larger than average with stocky builds. Their skin may be dusty like the dry earth, pebbled like rough hide, or hard &amp; polished like a smooth stone. Some even grow hard, rocky protrusions on their bodies. Beige, brown, and gray skin tones are common. Baldness is common, even among chijin women. If they do have hair, it's always brown or black.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kujin physical manifestations are a mystery. There are so few examples, it's unknown what physical traits they may typically have. One example though is the famed kujin philosopher Hiyozen, who had many odd manifestations. He was disproportionately tall and slim, reaching 6.5ft tall but weighing only 175lbs. His hair had streaks of dark purple and white. It was rumored his eyes would become like a starry night sky when he sleepwalked. As Hiyozen aged, it's written that his skin became thin and the bones of his face, hands, and feet could be seen to an extreme degree. It's possible other kujin may turn out like this, or perhaps they will manifest in other ways.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>All Over the Place</h5>
				<p>Kami suffuse the world with spiritual energy. When they manifest, they embody that energy and warp reality around them. There are infinite varieties. Though categorized above for the sake of the game, the kami-touched are just as varied as their namesakes. Each leads their own life and impacts the world they live in. Many become famous for their wild exploits or sacred havens.</p>
